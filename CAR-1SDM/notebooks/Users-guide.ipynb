    "> ## Summary\n",
    "This document is a guide to use the models described in the paper: *A joint distribution framework to improve presence-only species distribution models by exploiting opportunistic surveys* (EscamillaMolgora,2021) for modelling species distributions with presence-only data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The presented framework proposes three bayesian models for inferring single species distributions using solely observations of species occurrences (i.e. presence-only data).\n",
    "The fundamental idea of the framework is that the observed occurrences ($Y$) are determined not only by the environmental conditions (niche) suitable for the species to thrive but also accounts for the bias in which these observations were collected (i.e. sampling effort). As such, the occurrences are specified as realisations of a join process composed of environmental conditions ($P_Y$) and sampling effort ($P_X$). These two components are explicitly defined with a model-based approach (cite:Diggle2002) to specify two types of covariates, one for $P_X$ and other for $P_Y$.\n",
    "Both processes are specified as mixed models. That is, they are composed of  a fixed effect (i.e. $E(P_X) = g(d_X;\\beta_X)$ and $E(P_Y) = g(d_Y;\\beta_Y)$) and a random effect that models the variation between observations across space. For the purposes of this example (and the presented results in the manuscript) we consider $g(d_X;\\beta_X)$ to be linear, that is: $g(d_X;\\beta_X) = \\beta_X^t d_X$, where $d_X$ is the vector of covariates associated to a given observation. For a clear description of the model refer to the manuscript and, specifically, to the supplementary materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependencies between processes $P_X$ and $P_Y$ are specified in terms of the covariance between all observations. That is, by their random effects; $R_X$ and $R_Y$ respectively. We proposed three forms to model these dependencies. Model I assumes $R_X$ and $R_Y$ are independent. Model II assumes that $R_X = R_Y$ and Model III assumes both random effects are correlated. The three models specify a conditional autoregressive (CAR) (Besag,1974) model for defining the spatial random effect. Therefore, this framework is only suited for data aggregated in areas tilled over a region (i.e. spatial lattices).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we will apply models I, II and III in the *R* programming language using the package CARBayes (Lee,2013). The data used was obtained from GBIF using the dataset (gbifmexdata). This document is intended to serve as a guide for modelling species distributions using the aforementioned framework. For further reference of the Bayesian methodologies, diagnoses and deeper analysis of lattice-based models refer to (Lee,2013;Rue,2005)\n",
